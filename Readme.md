Authors: Mario Alonso Rodriguez and Raju Adhikari

Repository on Github: Assignment3 

Datasets used in the Repository:
1. World Bank Data on Gini Index and GDP per capita
2. EDGAR (EU Commission) on CO2 time series 1990-2014 per capita for world countries

Research Topic: Effects of income inequality on the environment.

We have merged the datasets and performed some basic descriptive and inferential statistics. 

The purpose has been to see the relationship between income inequality and the environment. GINI Coefficient is an important variable that measures income inequality while carbon emissions can be used to measure the effect on environment. We have put these two variables together to see the effect we intend to analyze.
